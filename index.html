		<h2>Roman Type</h2>

			<p>In Latin-script typography, roman is one of the three main kinds of historical type, 
			alongside blackletter and italic. Roman type was modelled on a European scribal manuscript 
			style of the 1400s, based on pairing Roman square capitals used in ancient Rome with Carolingian 
			minuscules developed in the Holy Roman Empire.[1]</p>

			<p>During the early Renaissance, a publication would use either roman or italic type, 
			not both. Today, roman and italic type are mixed, using roman for most of the text and italic for special purposes. 
			Most typeface families include, at a minimum, roman, italic or oblique, and boldface character sets.</p>

			<p>The word roman, without a capital R, customarily denotes 
			Italian typefaces used during the Renaissance period and later upright typefaces derived from them. 
			With a capital R, Roman refers to letter forms dating from ancient Rome.[2][page needed][3][page needed] 
			Popular roman typefaces include Bembo, Baskerville, Caslon, Bodoni, Times New Roman and Garamond.</p>

			<h1>San Serif Typefaces</h1>
			<a name="humanist"></a>
			<h2> Humanist</h2>

			<p>These are the most calligraphic of the sans-serif typefaces, with some variation in line width and more legibility than other sans-serif fonts. 
			Many take extensive inspiration from serif fonts, with true italic designs, ligatures and even swashes in italic.</p>

			<p>The origin of the humanist designs can't be pinpointed to a particular movement, 
			but to the specific needs of the Frank Pick-led London Underground, which resulted in the creation of the Johnston typeface (Edward Johnston, 1916), 
			and, a decade later, to Monotype's Stanley Morison, who commissioned the development of a complete typographic family (Gill Sans, 1928) 
			after seeing the potential in the sans-serif lettering of Johnston's disciple, Eric Gill.[27]</p>

			<p>Edward Johnston, a calligrapher by profession, was inspired by classic letter forms, with capitals based on roman inscriptions, 
			but also sought clarity by using the simplest possible forms: the lowercase "o" is a perfect circle and constitutes the base for the bowls 
			of other letters; also, while the stroke thickness is exactly 1/7th of the capital height, as per calligraphic tradition, it's completely uniform, 
			without any compensation for optical distortions.[27]</p>

			<p>While Johnston's typeface experienced limited popularity, since it wasn't available for general use, 
			Gill's sans, an evolution of Johnston's sans, became one of the most popular typefaces in Britain, 
			albeit enjoying little-to-no fame outside of it.[28]</p>

			<p>During the following decades there were a number of experiments with thick and thin sans-serifs, 
			among them Stellar (Robert Hunter Middleton, 1929) and Lydian (Warren Chappell, 1938), which culminated in Hermann Zapf's Optima (1958), 
			a typeface expressly designed to be used both for display and running text.[29]</p>

			<p>Other examples include: Antique Olive, Calibri, Lucida Grande, Segoe UI, Myriad, Frutiger, Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana.</p>

			<a name="geometric"></a>
			<h2>Geometric</h2>

			<p>As their name suggests, Geometric sans-serif typefaces are based on geometric shapes, 
			like near-perfect circle and square. Note the optically circular letter "O" and the simple construction of the lowercase letter "a". 
			Geometric sans-serif fonts have a very modern look and feel. Of these four categories, 
			geometric fonts tend to be the least useful for body text.</p>

			<p>The geometric sans is strongly associated with the Bauhaus art school (1919-1933). 
			Two early efforts in designing geometric types were made by Herbert Bayer and Jakob Erbar, 
			who worked respectively on Universal Typeface (unreleased at the time but revived digitally 
			as Architype Bayer) and Erbar (circa 1925). In 1927 Futura, by Paul Renner, was released to great acclaim and popularity.[30]</p>

			<p>Other examples include: Kabel, Nobel, ITC Avant Garde, Century Gothic, Gotham and Drogowskaz.</p>

			<h1>Penguin</h1>

			<p>Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, 
			flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. 
			Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, 
			and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, 
			squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. 
			They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans. </p>

			<span class="image1">

			</span>

			<p>Although all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, 
			they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. 
			In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. 
			Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, lives near the equator.</p>

			<p>The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): 
			on average adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb) or more. 
			The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), 
			also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm (16 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). 
			Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, 
			while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's rule). 
			Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. 
			These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, 
			and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 
			2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.</p>

			<h1>Help</h1>
			<p>Help is any form of assisting others.</p>

			<p>Help may also refer to: Online help.</p>

			<h2>Online Help</h2>
			<p>Online help is topic-oriented, procedural or reference information delivered through computer software. 
			It is a form of user assistance. Most online help is designed to give assistance in the use of a software 
			application or operating system, but can also be used to present information on a broad range of subjects. 
			When online help is linked to the state of the application (what the user is doing), 
			it is called Context-sensitive help.</p>
